Welcome to our Lab for Tech Interviews Office Hours Lab 6, "Deploy an App": https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lw16gYCTE6pPh5SPJzRyFf38mFSzu514GUA7DkcE0Mw/

For this lab, we're going to walk through the creation of a Concentration app that has the following user stories and requirements.

## Core User Story
"I want an app that follows the rules of the game, Concentration, where you find matching pairs of cards."

## Requirements
<b>Requirements</b>
1. There should be a grid of 16 “cards” (8 pairs), arranged 4x4 and flipped to hide the card.
2. Clicking on a card should reveal it. You can’t have more than two cards revealed at a time.
3. If you click two cards and they match, they stay revealed. Otherwise, they flip back over.
4. When all cards are revealed, the game should let you know that you’ve won.
5. You should be able to play again without refreshing the app.


<b>Nice to Haves</b>
1. Having a timer that starts when you click your first card and stops when you reveal all cards.
2. Changing the grid size to have more pairs.
3. You do some fancy styling.

## Time Limit
~ 1 hour
